            <h2>Applying Bootstrap to HTML/CSS</h2>
            <h5>Jan 18, 2016</h5>
            <p>We all know that first impressions are vital to successful business and social interactions. In today’s society, webpages are increasingly becoming influential when presenting ourselves. I believe that if a webpage does not initially grab someone there is a large chance that they will leave the site sooner than they would have had it have something that grabbed their eye. Even for people who do not care about visuals as much when it comes to the web, if a page is hard to maneuver they will not spend time there.</p>
            <p>This is where well done HTML and CSS can come into play in vital ways. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to place content on a webpage, using tags to display and manipulate different content. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what is used to style the webpage and determine where the content set using HTML will lie within the page. Here are some examples of HTML and CSS tags respectively:</p>
            <pre>
            	HTML tags
            	…
            	…
            	…
            	CSS tags
            	…
            	…
            	…
            </pre>
            <p>Using only these two in conjunction, the HTML to determine the content and the CSS to style it, one can make a beautiful site, but will experience immense frustration in the process. But wait! The Bootstrap library, developed by the folks at Twitter, makes styling the webpage SO MUCH EASIER. One can apply already initialized classes inside a div tag that will automatically change the way the page looks. An example:</p>
            <pre>
            	<div class=“jumbotron”>
            	</div>
            </pre>
            <p>This applied tag can then be (optionally) further styled to fit the individual’s specific taste. The most used tool for customizing Bootstrap is the Box Model. </p>
            <pre>
            	<img src=“images/box-model.png”>
            </pre>
            <p>The box model is used to segregate the different parts of the page that surround each HTML aspect. The HTML (content) is surrounds by three aspects: the margin, the border, and the padding. </p>
            <p><bold>Margin:</bold> transparent area between articles on the webpage. Provides spacing without affecting anything but layout on the page.</p>
            <p><bold>Border:</bold> surrounds the padding; may be partially or fully applied to an element on the webpage to add a visual separation (as with a line between sections on the page).</p>
            <p><bold>Padding:</bold>  creates transparent space around the content on a page</p>
            <p>Using the Bootstrap library in conjunction with the box model is an easy way to add specific styling to your webpage with minimal effort. </p>
