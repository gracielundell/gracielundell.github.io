          A mobile app aimed to help people get out more when visiting a new city through a social media-based scavenger hunt.
        </p>

      <div class="caseStudy">
        <h1>Preparation</h1>
        <p>
          Scout was inspired by the prompt to “design an app to help people get outside”. The idea our group came up with was to make an app fashioned after the idea of a scavenger hunt. Users would be guided through vague clues to destinations around a city, where they would gain points for every location they took a picture at.
        </p>
        <p>
          To come up with exactly what features our app would have, we began by brainstorming who our target audience would be, how to broaden this to attract individuals, and what the incentive of this idea would be. Users could customize their “adventure” by choosing a catagory that interested them the most, such as famous places, food, historic places, etc. From here, the app would give you a set list of places to go to. Eventually, the goal would be to give users the capability to design their own adventures and invite their friends. Getting local businesses to sponser adventures would also be a goal met later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the outset of this project we knew that user flow would be a vital element. We styled the use of our app by taking inspiration from the leading social image sharing sites of today, namely Instagram. We wanted to make something recognizable and comfortable to mordern web socialites. Our spin came from giving players rankings generated by their point count. This gives the app a competitive aspect that is not found in others of its kind.
        </p>
        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        <p>
           We chose the color palette on the premise of wanting a bright color for our call to actions, and a darker color to contrast this with. We noted that this kind of color pairing is common across social media apps. We wanted colors that were inviting and exciting. Gold and purple both have roots in symbolizing adventure and luxury: elements that are sought after when travelling somewhere new.
        </p>
        <p>
          We looked to the site, Pexels, as a jumping off point to find images of people on the go, travelling, and adventuring. Knowing our app was mostly focused on people exploring urban landscapes, we looked to city scenes for inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being an image-based app, we wanted to keep the use of images in the layout to a minumum. The main image we used was manipulated to look more abstract and subtle, and the rest of the app was kept focused on colors and page item layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The font used in our logo, Ostrich Sans (bold) was chosen because we wanted something modern and unique, since we knew this would be the main place it would be used. Raleway was used as the main font because it is sleek and gave a good contrast to the much heavier Phosphate.
        </p>

        <h1>Final Product</h1>
        <p>
          The final product for this project was a well-organized, flow-focused app, incorporating all the features required of modern social media apps. Users are able to add friends, see and like each other’s posts, as well as see pictures in their respective adventure sets. This app organizes posts by the adventure they were taken as a part of. Each picture in an adventure earns the user points, which are then displayed prominently at the top of each profile page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual profile is only half of the app: much of the styling and thought process went into designing the actual taking of the images and leading the user through their chosen adventure. Users are given the place they need to find, and then have the choice to “snap it” (meaning to take the picture and its points) or “skip it” (forfiting their points and moving on to the next challenge).
        </p>
        <div class="mainScreens">
          <div class="screenshot scoutpages">
            <img src="img/caseStudies/scout/screen1.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              This is the login page to our app. It displays our colors, logo, and name in all their glory. We wanted to make something that was minimal, since our app is so image-based, yet inviting.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot scoutpages">
            <img src="img/caseStudies/scout/screen2.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              This is our “home” page inside the app. The whole app is focused on getting people out so we wanted starting new adventures to be the focal point. If I were to redesign any part of this app, it would be this page. I would want to reverse the order of the purple and white information fields. I feel like it is confusingly set up, asking the user to set their location and catagory after where those pieces of information are displayed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot scoutpages">
            <img src="img/caseStudies/scout/screen3.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              This page shows how each new location in an adventure is presented: the places’ title, some background, its point value, and the option to view a hint. It also is where users choose to snap or skip this item on their iternerary.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="screenshot scoutpages">
            <img src="img/caseStudies/scout/screen4.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              This is what a user’s profile page looks like. Unlike Instagram, this app sorts your posted content by placing it in a subsection of its adventure. The large checkmarks show which adventures have been completed. The third icon in from the left is a link to see all adventures in progress.
            </p>

        <p>
          This is an app that I think could and should be made real. It would be useful for people travelling somewhere new to find things to do, as well as people who want to explore new parts of their city. It has a very modern feel and well thought-out navigation. Our end product was a creative solution to the given prompt, as well as something people would actually want to use.
